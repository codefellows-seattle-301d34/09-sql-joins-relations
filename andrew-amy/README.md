**Author**: Amy Cohen and Andrew Peacock
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are creating a blog platform the allows for dynamically updating both front-end and back-end while also providing persistance to the data.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
You will need to fork and clone from the class lab repo. You will need to have the scripts for Handlebars and Highlight. You need to have access to postgres and nodemon and live-server. Yoou will also need to run npm i the first time you open this program. Have express installed.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
